## Color Coordinated Challenges
Sync,hue is a platforming game where everything is controlled by color. The player, the environment, and even enemies have synchronized movement with objects of the corresponding color. However, this doesn't mean you have direct control over everything â€” you simply have a blue button and an orange button, and you must discover how the other colors work to pass each challenge.
